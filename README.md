# Ramdom-Forest

This code snippet is designed to perform stroke diagnosis prediction using a Random Forest Classifier. It is implemented in Python and uses popular libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn for machine learning tasks. The script follows these steps:

Importing Necessary Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection: To split the dataset into training and testing sets.
RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.ensemble: To use the Random Forest algorithm for classification.
classification_report and confusion_matrix from sklearn.metrics: To evaluate the performance of the classifier.

Loading the Dataset:
The dataset, named 'Stroke_preprocessed.csv', is loaded from a specified file path. This dataset presumably contains preprocessed data relevant for stroke diagnosis.

Data Preparation:
The feature set (X) is created by dropping the 'Diagnosis' column from the data, which represents the variables used for prediction.
The target variable (y) is set as the 'Diagnosis' column, indicating the outcome of stroke diagnosis.

Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets:
The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using the train_test_split function. The random_state parameter ensures reproducibility of results.

Random Forest Classifier:
A Random Forest Classifier is initialized with 100 trees (n_estimators=100) and a set random_state for reproducibility.
The classifier is trained using the training data.

Making Predictions and Evaluation:
The trained model is used to predict stroke diagnoses on the test set.
The performance of the model is evaluated using a classification report and confusion matrix. The classification report provides key metrics like precision, recall, and f1-score for each class. The confusion matrix shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class.

This script is suitable for inclusion in a project focused on medical diagnosis prediction, specifically for stroke prediction. The Random Forest algorithm is chosen for its effectiveness in handling complex datasets with high accuracy and handling both binary and multiclass classification tasks.
